This project involved end-to-end development, where I managed the entire process from initial setup to final deployment. Relying on Figma mockups provided, I crafted each aspect of the website using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to ensure a seamless and responsive user experience that effectively showcases the photographer’s work. Key elements included:

→ Responsive Design Implementation: Crafted a responsive layout to ensure optimal viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices, allowing users to appreciate the photographer's portfolio seamlessly across all screen sizes.

→ Custom WordPress Theme: Built a unique WordPress theme based on the provided design mockups, ensuring a tailored look and functionality that met the photographer's specific needs and enhanced the site’s personalization.

→ Advanced Photo Filtering and Ajax Loading: Implemented an interactive filtering system, enabling users to sort photos by category with Ajax-powered infinite scrolling, providing a smooth, uninterrupted browsing experience without page reloads.

→ Full-Screen Lightbox Integration: Added a full-screen lightbox feature, allowing users to view photos in detail, which creates an immersive experience when exploring the portfolio.

→ Custom Post Types and ACF Management: Leveraged the Custom Post Type UI (CPT UI) and Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugins to create and manage dynamic content, streamlining the process for adding and organizing photo collections.
