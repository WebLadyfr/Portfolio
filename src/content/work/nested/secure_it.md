 This project required comprehensive involvement, from recovery to optimization. I worked with the Avada template to build and customize the site according to the company’s needs. Using tools like MySQL and phpMyAdmin, I recovered the website data from the server, enabling a seamless restoration and setup for ongoing improvements. Key contributions included:

→ Database Recovery and Local Setup: Retrieved the website from a remote server’s database after WordPress credentials were lost. Set up the site locally to enable necessary modifications and ensure data integrity.

→ Header Redesign and Optimization: Rebuilt the website header to enhance usability and visual appeal, focusing on user accessibility and streamlined navigation.

→ Comprehensive SEO Management: Implemented full SEO strategies, including keyword optimization, metadata, and structured content to improve search engine rankings and reach a broader audience. Continuously updated content to support ongoing visibility and relevance.

→ Content Development and Site Performance Optimization: Regularly added new, informative content to address client needs and enhance the user experience. Conducted site reviews and optimizations to improve loading speeds, responsiveness, and overall quality.
