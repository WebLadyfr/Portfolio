For this project, I integrated a Figma design into a responsive e-commerce website for Planty, an energy drink brand. Using a WordPress setup with a custom child theme, I tailored the design to meet specific brand requirements.

→ Theme Customization: Installed and customized a WordPress child theme to ensure brand alignment and future adaptability.

→ Page Building: Built pages using Elementor, allowing for detailed, section-specific customizations that followed the Figma mockup precisely.

→ Form Management: Configured both the contact and order forms using WP Forms, making sure they were functional and visually aligned with the site’s aesthetics.

→ Responsive Design: Ensured the site displayed correctly across all screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile), maintaining usability from 320px and above.
