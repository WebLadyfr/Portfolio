For this project, I optimized the functionality and user experience of the Maison Halayla website built with Shopify. Here are the key actions taken:

→ Footer Customization: I used Shopify’s Liquid to customize the footer, ensuring consistent navigation and display across all pages.

→ Collection Management: I created and organized product collections directly through Shopify’s native admin interface, providing an easy and flexible system for showcasing products and categories.

→ Homepage Optimization: I implemented dynamic sections on the homepage to highlight featured products and collections. These sections are easily customizable and updated via Shopify’s admin interface.

→ Responsive Design: I ensured the site is fully responsive, offering an optimal browsing experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

These improvements simplified site management and enhanced the user experience, making the Maison Halayla website more engaging and efficient.
