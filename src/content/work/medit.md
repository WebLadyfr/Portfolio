For this project, I resolved critical issues and restored functionality to the website of MedIt, an SME specializing in custom IT solutions for the medical sector. Key actions included:

→ Debugging Setup: Enabled error logging via wp_config.php to analyze issues in the debug.log file.

→ Plugin Updates: Updated all plugins and the parent theme to resolve compatibility issues.

→ Plugin Conflict Resolution: Identified and deactivated problematic plugins (Ocean Extra and Astra WordPress Security – Worker) using Query Monitor.

→ Code Fixes: Removed duplicate contact_btn function from header.php and functions.php and corrected the Hook for consistent contact button display.

→ Popup Repair: Updated Google Maps integration in header.php and replaced JavaScript with a script in script.js (child theme) for popup closure functionality.

→ Contact Form Fix: Corrected the shortcode to ensure proper display within the popup.

These efforts restored the site's stability and functionality, ensuring an improved user experience.
